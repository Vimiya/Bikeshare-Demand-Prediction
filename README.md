## End to End ML Project

This case study is about a bike rental company. They want to predict the demand of bikes at any given hour of the day, so that, they can arrange for sufficient number of bike for the customers.

They have shared the hourly rental data for  two years.

Task here is to create a machine learning model which can predict the count of bikes rented at a given hour of the day.

**The goal here is to build an end-to-end regression task. Here the result will be given by the best performing hyper tuned Machine Learning model.**

In below case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a Machine Learning predictive model in such scenarios.

You can use this flow as a template to solve any supervised ML Regression problem!

* Reading the data in python
* Defining the problem statement
* Identifying the Target variable
* Looking at the distribution of Target variable
* Basic Data exploration
* Rejecting useless columns
* Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
* Feature Selection based on data distribution
* Outlier treatment
* Missing Values treatment
* Visual correlation analysis
* Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
* Converting data to numeric for ML
* Sampling and cross validation
* Trying multiple Regression algorithms
* Selecting the best Model
* Deploying the best model in production
